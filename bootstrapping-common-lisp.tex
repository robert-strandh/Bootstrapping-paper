\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The most common technique for building an executable \commonlisp{}
implementations, is to use a technique known as
\textit{bootstrapping}, i.e., the executable code is built from
\emph{source code} using a number of tools such a \emph{language
  processors}, shell tools, etc.  The \commonlisp{} implementations
that are not built this way evolve through careful modification of an
existing \emph{image}.

Most of the implementations that are built using bootstrapping have a
large component written in some lower-level language; typically
\clanguage{}.  The only widespread \commonlisp{} implementation
written mainly in \commonlisp{}, and that is built with bootstrapping,
is \sbcl{}

We argue that there is no particular reason why a \commonlisp{}
implementation should be written in anything other than \commonlisp{},
and we investigate reasons why so many existing implementations have
such a large fraction of the code written in languages that are not
particularly adapted for this task.
